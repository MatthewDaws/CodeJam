# Google Code Jam #

I'm currently doing the [2015 Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam).  This repository contains my solutions to this current, and past, contests.  Mostly in Python, but longer-term plan to have some C++ and, especially, C# here.  Once the 2015 Code Jam ends, I imagine updates here will become sporadic...

You can obtain the input files from the official Code Jam website.  All scripts are designed to be run from the command prompt in the form `executable < file.in > file.out` and then `file.out` to be uploaded to the Code Jam website.
